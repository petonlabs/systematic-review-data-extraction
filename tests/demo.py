Title: Antimicrobial Resistance in Surgical Site Infections Following Colorectal Surgery: A Prospective Cohort Study

Abstract:
Background: Surgical site infections (SSIs) remain a significant complication following colorectal surgery, with increasing concerns about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of SSIs and characterize AMR patterns in a tertiary care hospital.

Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 324 adult patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery at General Hospital from January 2022 to December 2023. Patients were followed for 30 days post-operatively for SSI development. Microbiological samples were collected from all SSIs and analyzed for pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

Results: The overall SSI rate was 15.4% (50/324 patients). The most common pathogens isolated were Escherichia coli (32%), Enterococcus faecalis (24%), and Staphylococcus aureus (18%). High rates of resistance were observed: 45% of E. coli isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, 67% of Enterococcus isolates showed vancomycin resistance, and 23% of S. aureus were methicillin-resistant (MRSA).

Patients with SSIs had significantly longer hospital stays (median 12 days vs 5 days, p<0.001) and higher readmission rates (28% vs 8%, p<0.001). The additional cost per SSI patient was estimated at $8,450.

Risk factors associated with SSI included BMI >30 (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.4), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.2), and prolonged operative time >180 minutes (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.5).

Conclusions: SSIs following colorectal surgery show concerning patterns of antimicrobial resistance. Implementation of enhanced infection control measures and antimicrobial stewardship programs are urgently needed.

Duration: 24 months (2022-2023)
Sample Size: 324 patients

Gender: 52% female, 48% male
