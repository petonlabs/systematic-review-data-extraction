        This study examines surgical site infections in low-resource settings. 
        The main drivers of antimicrobial resistance identified include overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics, 
        poor infection control practices, and lack of diagnostic capacity. 
        The authors propose several innovations including a bundle approach combining 
        preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis with enhanced surveillance. 
        Key gaps identified by the authors include insufficient laboratory capacity 
        and lack of antimicrobial stewardship programs. 
        Policy responses needed include implementation of national stewardship guidelines
