I am using uv as the package manager.

I am using dspy as the agent framework.

Always read dspy docs, prefer fetching them before implementation

Be as light as possible use solid principles, contextual logging.

Always try new tests inside tests/ directly, and confirm full compatibility wth other tests and the overall test setup
You can do file and file enhanced if you mess up syntax, but always clean up the alternatively named files and return to the base file with fixed syntax

remember, uv, virtual environment
